- '.then()' and '.catch()' are both methods available when working with promises. When a promise resolves, .then() is invoked. When a promise fails to resolve, .catch() is invoked. Both methods can take callback functions as parameters to handle the results accordingly.

- Promises allow us perform operations asynchronously in JavaScript despite the fact JavaScript is a single-threaded language. This is important because it allows us to avoid blocking. If a piece of code may take considerable time to execute, a fetch call for example, we don't want that execution to delay the rest of our code from running. Promises offer a solution to this scenario.  

- async/await is a very straightforward and readable syntax for writing JavaScript promises. The word “async” before a function indicates it will return a promise. async/await is available in ES7.
